# Mac smoke test

By hand, on the build from `cd mac && SIGN_IDENTITY=- ./build.sh`. Run before every Mac release;
M0 is the first pass. Each line is a check: do the action, see the result.

## 0. Setup

- [ ] Quit any running Sanduhr and Sanduhr Desk (`pkill -x Sanduhr; pkill -f "Sanduhr Desk"`).
- [ ] `lipo -archs mac/Sanduhr.app/Contents/MacOS/Sanduhr` prints `x86_64 arm64`.
- [ ] Back up every domain the app reads, so section 1 can start empty and section 7 can restore:
  ```
  mkdir -p ~/sanduhr-smoke
  for d in com.626labs.sanduhr com.626labs.sanduhr.desk com.626labs.sanduhrdesk com.estevan.desk; do
    defaults export $d ~/sanduhr-smoke/$d.plist 2>/dev/null
  done
  ```
- [ ] URL schemes go to whichever copy LaunchServices registered last. If
  `/Applications/Sanduhr.app` is the old 2.0.4, `open sanduhr://…` lands there. Register the dev
  build first: `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -f mac/Sanduhr.app`.

## 1. Fresh defaults: Desk is home

- [ ] `for d in com.626labs.sanduhr com.626labs.sanduhr.desk com.626labs.sanduhrdesk com.estevan.desk; do defaults delete $d 2>/dev/null; done`
  (credentials and history are files under `~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/`, not touched).
- [ ] `open mac/Sanduhr.app`. Desk is on at once: message top left, clock and the Claude meters
  bottom left on the desktop. No black island around the notch; no Calendar permission prompt.
- [ ] The widget appears top right for sign-in. With no session key, the onboarding sheet shows;
  Continue opens Sanduhr Settings at Credentials; paste the key and Save. (A session key left over from before the wipe skips the sheet.)
- [ ] After the first successful fetch the widget hides by itself and the meters fill in. The menu
  bar hourglass shows the percent; left-click brings the widget back.
- [ ] `defaults read com.626labs.sanduhr.desk` shows `deskEnabled = 1`, `layout = "message:tl clock:bl meters:bl meetings:bl"`,
  `showMeetings = 0`, `notch = 0` and `migrated = 1`. `defaults read com.626labs.sanduhr` shows
  `deskFirstRunDone = 1`, `panelHidden = 1` and no `tuckAfterFirstFetch`.
- [ ] Show the widget, quit and relaunch: the widget stays shown (it tucks only once); Desk is unchanged.
- [ ] Existing user: quit Sanduhr, `defaults import` each backed-up domain from `~/sanduhr-smoke/`
  (section 0), relaunch: widget and Desk come back exactly as before the wipe (Desk still off if it
  was off; the widget not tucked). The rest of the run continues from these settings.

## 2. Widget

- [ ] Cards fill in after the first fetch (sign in via Settings, Credentials if the key is gone).
- [ ] Left-click the menu bar hourglass hides the widget; again shows it. Hidden survives a relaunch.
- [ ] Right-click opens the status menu: Hide (or Show) Sanduhr; Tools: Deep Work, Pacing Calculators, Cooldown Snake; Refresh, Settings…, Check for Updates…; Quit Sanduhr. Two-finger click on the widget lists the same items in the same order (always Hide Sanduhr there). Check for Updates… from the widget's menu opens Sparkle's check.
- [ ] Refresh updates the footer time; `~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/snapshot.json` has a new `captured_at`.
- [ ] Gear on the widget opens Sanduhr Settings. Widget, Look: pick a font and subtle mode, the widget changes as you pick. Themes: Reload lists the installed user themes. Switch a theme on the widget's strip, toggle compact (panel resizes, top edge stays put), open the focus timer and close it.

## 3. Alerts

- [ ] Settings, Alerts: turn alerts on; macOS asks for notification permission once. Allow.
- [ ] Set the session line below the current 5-hour percent, Refresh: one banner.
- [ ] Refresh again: no second banner (once per tier per reset window).
- [ ] Put the line back where it was.
- [ ] Turn on "Warn when I'm on pace to run out before the reset". On a busy session (past 10% of the window, 20% or more used, the widget showing "At current pace, expires in …"), Refresh: one banner "Session on pace to run out at <time>", body "Resets <time>." Refresh again: no second one.
- [ ] Sound: pick Glass, Preview plays it; Send a Test plays Glass with the banner. Pick None: Preview is off and Send a Test is silent. Back to Default.
- [ ] Where alerts show, Desk pulse (Desk on, meters on the desktop, notch on): Send a Test posts no banner; the session meter glows three times over about three seconds and the notch island's edge glows with it. Banner and Desk pulse: both. Turn Desk off with Desk pulse chosen: Send a Test shows a banner.
- [ ] Quiet hours on, from a minute ago to an hour from now, Banner: set the session line below the current percent, Refresh: no banner, no sound. With Banner and Desk pulse, the meter still pulses. Turn quiet hours off and Refresh: still no banner (that window's alert was recorded). Put everything back.

## 4. Desk

- [ ] Hide the widget, with Ice hiding the menu bar hourglass: Option+S opens one window titled "Sanduhr Settings", a sidebar with General, Alerts, Credentials; Desk: Layout, Look, Message, Notch; Widget: Look, Themes, Pacing & Focus. Every section opens and edits with the widget still hidden. Settings… in the widget's menu and the hourglass's menu bring the same window forward (never a second one); there is no "Sanduhr Desk" window and no settings sheet on the widget.
- [ ] General, Surfaces: Widget off hides the widget and on shows it (the switch follows the hourglass too); Notch flips the island (Desk on). Pacing & Focus, "Pin the pacing calculators" and Tools, Pacing Calculators show the same state: flip one, the other follows.
- [ ] After section 1, Desk is already on: clock, date, message and the meters (a bar per limit with a pace tick and reset time). General, Surfaces, Desk is on. The notch stays plain (its own switch, off).
- [ ] General, "Read today's meetings" (off on a fresh install): switch it on and the Calendar prompt appears right away, no restart. Allow: today's remaining timed meetings show. Switch it off: they go.
- [ ] Meters: their pace ticks sit where the widget's do; hide the widget and refresh from the menu, and the meters still update.
- [ ] Hint: on the first run with meters on the desktop, "Click the meters for history and tools. Option+S for settings." shows under them in the Desk font. `defaults read com.626labs.sanduhr.desk meterHintFirstShown` prints the time it first showed.
- [ ] Meter click: hide the widget, point at the meters (the pointer turns into a hand), click. The widget appears beside them (to their right in a left corner, to their left in a right corner), fully on screen, in front. The hint is gone and stays gone after a relaunch (`meterHintDismissed = 1`).
- [ ] Click the meters again with the widget showing: it comes forward and does not move. Drag it elsewhere, hide it with the hourglass and show it again with the hourglass: it comes back where it was dragged, not beside the meters.
- [ ] Click empty desktop beside the meters: Finder gets it (desktop icons select). Put a Finder window over the meters and click it there: the window takes the click, no widget.
- [ ] Hint expiry: quit, `defaults write com.626labs.sanduhr.desk meterHintFirstShown -date "2026-01-01 00:00:00 +0000"; defaults delete com.626labs.sanduhr.desk meterHintDismissed`, relaunch: no hint. `defaults delete com.626labs.sanduhr.desk meterHintFirstShown`, relaunch: the hint is back (tidy up by clicking the meters).
- [ ] Tools with Ice hiding the hourglass and the widget hidden: click the meters, two-finger click the widget, Tools: Deep Work opens the hourglass overlay, Cooldown Snake the game, Pacing Calculators keeps cool-down or surplus showing on every card (checked; choose again to put them back under the pointer), Hide Sanduhr hides it.
- [ ] Tools from the menu bar hourglass's menu, widget hidden first each time: Show Sanduhr shows it; Deep Work, Cooldown Snake and Pacing Calculators each show the widget with that tool open. With `menuIcon` on, Desk's clock menu lists today's meetings and Join next meeting, then the same items as the hourglass's menu in the same order. A tool open on the widget shows checked in all three menus.
- [ ] Layout: move Clock to Top right; it moves live. Hide Meetings; they go. Put both back.
- [ ] Look: ink `9ad7ff, 012089` (space after the comma) on the message draws blue to navy, no gray.
- [ ] Message: `~/Library/Application Support/Desk/messages.txt` exists with the starter lines; add a `MM-DD: smoke test` line for today, and within a minute the desktop shows it.
- [ ] Meeting rows with a Teams/Zoom/Meet link: pointer turns into a hand; click opens it. Clicking empty desktop still reaches Finder.
- [ ] General, Surfaces, turn Desk off: desktop layer (and notch, if on) go. On again: they come back (repeat twice; no doubled refreshes in Console).

## 5. Notch (Mac with a notch only)

- [ ] Settings, Notch shows "Extend the camera notch" off. Turn it on: black wings extend the notch left and right; left wing shows the time or the next meeting within the hour, right wing shows `5h N%  wk N%`.
- [ ] Strip under the notch draws when Notch, "Extra height below" is above 0; its text appears with "Under the camera too".
- [ ] Click the island: Sanduhr Settings opens.
- [ ] Quit and relaunch: the notch is still on (the switch saved). Turn it off: wings and strip go, Desk layer stays.
- [ ] Full-screen an app: wings stay above it. Switch Spaces: wings stay.
- [ ] External display as main: no island drawn.

## 6. Links and keys

- [ ] `open sanduhr://settings` and `open estedesk://settings` both open Sanduhr Settings.
- [ ] `open estedesk://join-next` opens the next meeting with a link, or beeps when there is none.
- [ ] Remove or comment out any skhd binding for alt - j and alt - s first (`skhd --reload`), or skhd answers before Sanduhr and this proves nothing.
- [ ] With Desk on, from any app: Option+J joins the next meeting (or beeps), Option+S opens Sanduhr Settings. No Accessibility prompt.
- [ ] In a text field, Option+S does not type ß while Desk is on (expected cost). General, Shortcuts off: Option+S types ß again, Option+J types ∆. Back on: shortcuts work again.
- [ ] Desk off: Option+S types ß; the shortcuts are gone.

## 7. Migration from Sanduhr Desk, then restore

- [ ] Quit Sanduhr. `defaults delete com.626labs.sanduhr.desk`, then
  `defaults import com.626labs.sanduhrdesk ~/sanduhr-smoke/com.626labs.sanduhrdesk.plist`.
- [ ] Launch: Desk comes on by itself with the old layout, colors and font (EsteFont if none was set).
  A running Sanduhr Desk app is quit.
- [ ] The notch is on (the old apps defaulted it on), unless it was switched off there.
- [ ] Restore: quit Sanduhr, then
  `for f in ~/sanduhr-smoke/*.plist; do defaults import "$(basename "$f" .plist)" "$f"; done`.

## 8. Intel slice

- [ ] On an Intel Mac, or `arch -x86_64 mac/Sanduhr.app/Contents/MacOS/Sanduhr` under Rosetta:
  launches, widget fetches. Quit.
