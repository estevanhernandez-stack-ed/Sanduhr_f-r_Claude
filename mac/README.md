# Sanduhr für Claude — macOS (SwiftUI)

Native Mac rewrite of the [Python/tkinter widget](../sanduhr.py). Feature parity
plus real vibrancy, SF Pro, and no dock icon.

## Build

Requires macOS 14+ and Xcode 15+ command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```
./build.sh                 # release build → Sanduhr.app, universal (arm64 + x86_64)
SIGN_IDENTITY=- ./build.sh # same, ad-hoc signed (no Developer ID needed)
./build.sh --debug         # native-arch debug build (faster iteration)
./test.sh                  # swift test, with the SDK and plugin paths the command line tools need
```

Smoke tools for a running dev build (window shots, the UI tree as YAML, scenarios): see
[smoke/README.md](smoke/README.md).

Run the result:

```
open Sanduhr.app
```

## Release

Signed, notarized releases are built by GitHub Actions; setup and steps are in
[docs/mac-release.md](../docs/mac-release.md).

## Package as a drag-install DMG

For the classic "drag the app onto Applications" experience:

```
./make-dmg.sh              # builds app if needed, produces Sanduhr.dmg
./make-dmg.sh --skip-build # reuse existing Sanduhr.app
```

`open Sanduhr.dmg` mounts a window showing the app next to an Applications
alias — drag across to install, eject the DMG, done. Uses only `hdiutil` +
`osascript`, no Homebrew or extra tools.

## First run

1. Go to <https://claude.ai>, sign in.
2. Open DevTools (⌥⌘I) → Application → Cookies → `claude.ai`.
3. Copy the `sessionKey` value.
4. In Sanduhr, click **Continue** on the onboarding sheet, then paste the key.

Where the key is stored depends on the build:

- **Release builds** (signed with the Developer ID, as every published release is): the
  macOS Keychain, as generic-password items under service `com.626labs.sanduhr` (accounts
  `sessionKey` and `cf_clearance`), readable after first unlock with no Touch ID prompt. The
  item trusts Sanduhr's signature, so updates read it without asking. Updating from 2.3.1 or
  earlier moves the key out of the old file once: Sanduhr writes the Keychain, reads it back,
  and only then deletes the file; if anything fails it keeps the file and carries on with it.
- **Dev builds** (`./build.sh --debug`, ad-hoc signed): a permissions-restricted plaintext file
  at `~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/credentials.json` (mode `0600`, readable only by
  your user account). Every ad-hoc rebuild has a new signature, which would make the Keychain
  ask for your login password each time. `SANDUHR_KEYCHAIN=1` in the environment forces the
  Keychain on a dev build to test that path; expect that prompt after a rebuild.

`smoke/smoke state` reports which one is in use as `credentials_store`.

### Signing out

**Settings, Credentials, Sign Out** (after a confirmation) deletes the session key and
`cf_clearance` from both the Keychain and the file, whichever one the build uses, stops the
refresh and clears the shown usage. The widget says "Signed out — sign in" (click it for
Credentials), Desk and the notch show the sign-in line instead of meters, and `snapshot.json`
says `session_expired` with no tiers so the statusline and MCP server stop showing old numbers.
Your usage history and settings stay. Paste a key and Save to sign in again; no relaunch needed.
Signing out only removes the key from this Mac; it does not end the session on claude.ai.

Dragging Sanduhr to the Trash removes neither store: sign out first, or delete the
`com.626labs.sanduhr` items in Keychain Access (release builds) or
`~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/credentials.json` (dev builds).

### Cloudflare fallback

If the widget shows "Cloudflare — add cf_clearance", copy the `cf_clearance`
cookie the same way and paste it into the second field in **Settings, Credentials**.
Most accounts don't need this.

## Files

- `sessionKey` + `cf_clearance` → the Keychain, service `com.626labs.sanduhr` (release builds), or `~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/credentials.json` (mode `0600`, dev builds); see First run above
- Selected theme → `UserDefaults` (`theme`)
- Sparkline history → `~/Library/Application Support/Sanduhr/history.json`
- Window position → `UserDefaults` (`windowFrame`)
